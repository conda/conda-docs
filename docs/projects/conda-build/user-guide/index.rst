**Tutorials**

The :doc:`tutorials <../user-guide/tutorials/index>` will guide you through
how to build conda packages---whether you're creating a
package with compilers, using conda skeleton, creating from
scratch, or building R packages using skeleton CRAN.

**Recipes**

Conda-build uses :doc:`recipes <../user-guide/recipes/index>` to create conda packages.
We have guides on debugging conda recipes, sample recipes for you to use, and
information on how to build a package without a recipe.

**Environment variables**

Use our :doc:`environment variables <environment-variables>` guide
to understand which environment variables are available, set,
and inherited, and how they affect different processes.

**Wheel files**

The user guide includes information about
:doc:`wheel files <wheel-files>` and how to build conda
packages from them.
