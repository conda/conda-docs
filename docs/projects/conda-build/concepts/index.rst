What is a “package”?
--------------------

* A package is anything you install using your package manager.

* A "conda package" is a compressed tarball that contains

  * the module to be installed

  * information on how to install the package

* You can use conda-build to build a conda package.

What about channels
-------------------

* Channels contain packages.

* They conform to a standard structure and contain an index of available packages.

* An index of the available packages can be generated by running:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ conda index <path to channel>

* conda is able to install from channels and uses the indexes in the channel to
  solve for requirements and dependencies.

Building Anaconda installers
----------------------------

* Anaconda(/Miniconda) installers are built with a modified version of constructor.

* The idea is to build an Anaconda metapackage and bundle it together with some
  other packages to build an Anaconda installer.
