Managing environments
=====================

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1

With conda, you can create, export, list, remove and update
environments that have different versions of Python and/or
packages installed in them. Switching or moving between
environments is called activating the environment. You can also
share an environment file.

NOTE: There are many options available for the commands described
on this page. For details, see :doc:`../../commands`.


Creating an environment with commands
=====================================

TIP: By default, environments are installed into the ``envs``
directory in your conda directory. Run ``conda create --help``
for information on specifying a different path.

Use the Terminal or an Anaconda Prompt for the following steps.

#. To create an environment:

   .. code::

      conda create --name myenv

   NOTE: Replace ``myenv`` with the environment name.

#. When conda asks you to proceed, type ``y``:

   .. code::

      proceed ([y]/n)?

This creates the myenv environment in ``/envs/``. This
environment uses the same version of Python that you are
currently using, because you did not specify a version.

To create an environment with a specific version of Python:

.. code-block:: bash

      conda create -n myenv python=3.4

To create an environment with a specific package:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda create -n myenv scipy

OR:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda create -n myenv python
   conda install -n myenv scipy

To create an environment with a specific version of a package:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda create -n myenv scipy=0.15.0

OR:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda create -n myenv python
   conda install -n myenv scipy=0.15.0

To create an environment with a specific version of Python and
multiple packages:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda create -n myenv python=3.4 scipy=0.15.0 astroid babel

TIP: Install all the programs that you want in this environment
at the same time. Installing 1 program at a time can lead to
dependency conflicts.

To automatically install pip or another program every time a new
environment is created, add the default programs to the
:ref:`create_default_packages <config-add-default-pkgs>` section
of your ``.condarc`` configuration file. The default packages are
installed every time you create a new environment. If you do not
want the default packages installed in a particular environment,
use the ``--no-default-packages`` flag:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda create --no-default-packages -n myenv python

TIP: You can add much more to the ``conda create`` command.
For details, run ``conda create --help``.


Creating an environment from an environment.yml file
====================================================

Use the Terminal or an Anaconda Prompt for the following steps.

#. Create the environment from the ``environment.yml`` file:

   .. code::

      conda env create -f environment.yml

The name of the new environment will be gotten from the first line of the ``yml`` file. See `Creating an environment file manually`_ for more details.

#. Activate the new environment:

   * Windows: ``activate myenv``

   * macOS and Linux: ``source activate myenv``

   NOTE: Replace ``myenv`` with the name of the environment.

#. Verify that the new environment was installed correctly:

   .. code::

      conda list


Cloning an environment
=======================

Use the Terminal or an Anaconda Prompt for the following steps.

You can make an exact copy of an environment by creating a clone
of it:

.. code::

   conda create --name myclone --clone myenv

NOTE: Replace ``myclone`` with the name of the new environment.
Replace ``myenv`` with the name of the existing environment that
you want to copy.

To verify that the copy was made:

.. code::

   conda info --envs

In the environments list that displays, you should see both the
source environment and the new copy.


Building identical conda environments
=====================================

You can use explicit specification files to build an identical
conda environment on the same operating system platform, either
on the same machine or on a different machine.

Use the Terminal or an Anaconda Prompt for the following steps.

#. Run ``conda list --explicit`` to produce a spec list such as:

   .. code::

      # This file may be used to create an environment using:
      # $ conda create --name <env> --file <this file>
      # platform: osx-64
      @EXPLICIT
      https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/free/osx-64/mkl-11.3.3-0.tar.bz2
      https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/free/osx-64/numpy-1.11.1-py35_0.tar.bz2
      https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/free/osx-64/openssl-1.0.2h-1.tar.bz2
      https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/free/osx-64/pip-8.1.2-py35_0.tar.bz2
      https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/free/osx-64/python-3.5.2-0.tar.bz2
      https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/free/osx-64/readline-6.2-2.tar.bz2
      https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/free/osx-64/setuptools-25.1.6-py35_0.tar.bz2
      https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/free/osx-64/sqlite-3.13.0-0.tar.bz2
      https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/free/osx-64/tk-8.5.18-0.tar.bz2
      https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/free/osx-64/wheel-0.29.0-py35_0.tar.bz2
      https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/free/osx-64/xz-5.2.2-0.tar.bz2
      https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/free/osx-64/zlib-1.2.8-3.tar.bz2


#. To create this spec list as a file in the current working
   directory, run::

     conda list --explicit > spec-file.txt

   NOTE: You can use ``spec-file.txt`` as the filename or replace
   it with a filename of your choice.

An explicit spec file is not usually cross platform, and
therefore has a comment at the top such as ``# platform: osx-64``
showing the platform where it was created. This platform is the
one where this spec file is known to work. On other platforms,
the packages specified might not be available or dependencies
might be missing for some of the key packages already in the
spec.

To use the spec file to create an identical environment on the
same machine or another machine::

  conda create --name myenv --file spec-file.txt

To use the spec file to install its listed packages into an
existing environment::

  conda install --name myenv --file spec-file.txt

Conda does not check architecture or dependencies when installing
from a spec file. To ensure that the packages work correctly,
make sure that the file was created from a working environment,
and use it on the same architecture, operating system and
platform, such as linux-64 or osx-64.


.. _activate-env:

Activating an environment
=========================

To activate an environment:

* On Windows, in your Anaconda Prompt, run ``activate myenv``

* On macOS and Linux, in your Terminal Window, run ``source activate myenv``

Conda prepends the path name ``myenv`` onto your system command.


Deactivating an environment
===========================

To deactivate an environment:

* On Windows, in your Anaconda Prompt, run ``deactivate``

* On macOS and Linux, in your Terminal Window, run ``source deactivate``

Conda removes the path name ``myenv`` from your system command.

TIP: In Windows, it is good practice to deactivate one
environment before activating another.


.. _determine-current-env:

Determining your current environment
====================================

Use the Terminal or an Anaconda Prompt for the following steps.

By default, the active environment---the one you are currently
using---is shown in parentheses () or brackets [] at the
beginning of your command prompt::

  (myenv) $

If you do not see this, run:

.. code::

   conda info --envs

In the environments list that displays, your current environment
is highlighted with an asterisk (*).

By default, the command prompt is set to show the name of the
active environment. To disable this option::

  conda config --set changeps1 false

To re-enable this option::

  conda config --set changeps1 true


Viewing a list of your environments
===================================

To see a list of all of your environments, in your Terminal window or an
Anaconda Prompt, run:

.. code::

   conda info --envs

OR

.. code::

   conda env list

A list similar to the following is displayed:

.. code::

   conda environments:
   myenv                 /home/username/miniconda/envs/myenv
   snowflakes            /home/username/miniconda/envs/snowflakes
   bunnies               /home/username/miniconda/envs/bunnies


Viewing a list of the packages in an environment
================================================

To see a list of all packages installed in a specific environment:

* If the environment is not activated, in your Terminal window or an
  Anaconda Prompt, run:

  .. code-block:: bash

     conda list -n myenv

* If the environment is activated, in your Terminal window or an
  Anaconda Prompt, run:

  .. code-block:: bash

     conda list

To see if a specific package is installed in an environment, in your Terminal window or an
Anaconda Prompt, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda list -n myenv scipy


Using pip in an environment
===========================

To use pip in your environment, in your Terminal window or an
Anaconda Prompt, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install -n myenv pip
   source activate myenv
   pip <pip_subcommand>


Saving environment variables
============================

Conda environments can include saved environment variables.

Suppose you want an environment "analytics" to store both a
secret key needed to log in to a server and a path to a
configuration file. The sections below explain how to write a
script named ``env_vars`` to do this on :ref:`Windows
<win-save-env-variables>` and :ref:`macOS or Linux
<macos-linux-save-env-variables>`.

This type of script file can be part of a conda package, in
which case these environment variables become active when an
environment containing that package is activated.

You can name these scripts anything you like. However, multiple
packages may create script files, so be sure to use descriptive
names that are not used by other packages. One popular option is
to give the script a name in the form
``packagename-scriptname.sh``, or on Windows,
``packagename-scriptname.bat``.

.. _win-save-env-variables:

Windows
-------

#. Locate the directory for the conda environment in your
   Anaconda Prompt, such as ``C:\Users\jsmith\Anaconda3\envs\analytics``.

#. Enter that directory and create these subdirectories and
   files::

    cd C:\Users\jsmith\Anaconda3\envs\analytics
    mkdir .\etc\conda\activate.d
    mkdir .\etc\conda\deactivate.d
    type NUL > .\etc\conda\activate.d\env_vars.bat
    type NUL > .\etc\conda\deactivate.d\env_vars.bat

#. Edit ``.\etc\conda\activate.d\env_vars.bat`` as follows::

     set MY_KEY='secret-key-value'
     set MY_FILE=C:\path\to\my\file

#. Edit ``.\etc\conda\deactivate.d\env_vars.bat`` as follows::

     set MY_KEY=
     set MY_FILE=

When you run ``activate analytics``, the environment variables
MY_KEY and MY_FILE are set to the values you wrote into the file.
When you run ``deactivate``, those variables are erased.

.. _macos-linux-save-env-variables:

macOS and Linux
---------------

#. Locate the directory for the conda environment in your Terminal window, such as
   ``/home/jsmith/anaconda3/envs/analytics``.

#. Enter that directory and create these subdirectories and
   files::

     cd /home/jsmith/anaconda3/envs/analytics
     mkdir -p ./etc/conda/activate.d
     mkdir -p ./etc/conda/deactivate.d
     touch ./etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh
     touch ./etc/conda/deactivate.d/env_vars.sh

#. Edit ``./etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh`` as follows::

     #!/bin/sh

     export MY_KEY='secret-key-value'
     export MY_FILE=/path/to/my/file/

#. Edit ``./etc/conda/deactivate.d/env_vars.sh`` as follows::

     #!/bin/sh

     unset MY_KEY
     unset MY_FILE

When you run ``source activate analytics``, the environment
variables MY_KEY and MY_FILE are set to the values you wrote into
the file. When you run ``source deactivate``, those variables are
erased.


Sharing an environment
=======================

You may want to share your environment with someone else---for
example, so they can re-create a test that you have done. To
allow them to quickly reproduce your environment, with all of its
packages and versions, give them a copy of your
``environment.yml file``.

Exporting the environment file
-------------------------------

NOTE: If you already have an ``environment.yml`` file in your
current directory, it will be overwritten during this task.

#. Activate the environment to export:

   * On Windows, in your Anaconda Prompt, run ``activate myenv``

   * On macOS and Linux, in your Terminal window, run ``source activate myenv``

   NOTE: Replace ``myenv`` with the name of the environment.

#. Export your active environment to a new file::

     conda env export > environment.yml

   NOTE: This file handles both the environment's pip packages
   and conda packages.

#. Email or copy the exported ``environment.yml`` file to the
   other person.

Creating an environment file manually
-------------------------------------

You can create an environment file manually to share with others.

EXAMPLE: A simple environment file:

.. code::

    name: stats
    dependencies:
      - numpy
      - pandas

EXAMPLE: A more complex environment file:

.. code::

   name: stats2
   channels:
     - javascript
   dependencies:
     - python=3.4   # or 2.7
     - bokeh=0.9.2
     - numpy=1.9.*
     - nodejs=0.10.*
     - flask
     - pip:
       - Flask-Testing

You can exclude the default channels by adding ``nodefaults``
to the channels list.

.. code::

   channels:
     - javascript
     - nodefaults

This is equivalent to passing the ``--override-channels`` option
to most ``conda`` commands.

Adding ``nodefaults`` to the channels list in ``environment.yml``
is similar to removing ``defaults`` from the :ref:`channels
list <config-channels>` in the ``.condarc`` file. However,
changing ``environment.yml`` affects only one of your conda
environments while changing ``.condarc`` affects them all.

Creating an environment from the shared environment.yml file
------------------------------------------------------------

To create a new environment from ``environment.yml`` run:

.. code::

    conda create env -f environment.yml

Removing an environment
=======================

To remove an environment, in your Terminal window or an
Anaconda Prompt, run:

.. code::

   conda remove --name myenv --all

(You may instead use ``conda env remove --name myenv``.)

To verify that the environment was removed, in your Terminal window or an
Anaconda Prompt, run:

.. code::

   conda info --envs

The environments list that displays should not show the removed
environment.
