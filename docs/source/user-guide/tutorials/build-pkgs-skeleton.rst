This tutorial describes how to quickly build a conda package for
a Python module that is already available on PyPI.

In the first procedure, building a simple package, you build a
package that can be installed in any conda environment of the
same Python version as your root environment. The remaining
optional procedures describe how to build packages for other
Python versions and other architectures, as well as how to upload
packages to your Anaconda.org account.


Who is this for?
=================

This tutorial is for Windows, macOS and Linux users who wish to
build a conda package from a PyPI package. No prior knowledge of
conda build or conda recipes is required.


.. _before-you-start1:

Before you start
=================

Before you start, check the :doc:`prerequisites <index>`.


.. _conda-build-skeleton:

Building a simple package with conda skeleton pypi
==================================================

The ``conda skeleton`` command picks up the PyPI package metadata
and prepares the conda build recipe. The final step is to
build the package itself and install it into your conda environment.

It is easy to build a skeleton recipe for any Python package that
is hosted on PyPI, the official third-party software repository
for the Python programming language.

In this section you are going to use conda skeleton to generate a
conda recipe, which informs conda build about where the source
files are located and how to build and install the package.

You'll be working with a package named Pyinstrument_ that is
hosted on PyPI. Pyinstrument is a Python statistical profiler
that records the whole call stack once each millisecond, so
programmers can see which parts of their code are slowest and how
to make them faster.

.. _Pyinstrument: https://github.com/joerick/pyinstrument

First, in your user home directory, run the ``conda skeleton``
command:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda skeleton pypi pyinstrument

The two arguments to ``conda skeleton`` are the hosting location,
in this case ``pypi``, and the name of the package.

This creates a directory named ``Pyinstrument`` and creates the
skeleton file, ``meta.yaml`` in that directory. Download the other two
skeleton files: :download:`build.sh <build.sh>` ,
:download:`bld.bat <bld.bat>`. Save these files
in the same ``pyinstrument`` directory where the ``meta.yaml`` file is present.
Use the ``ls`` command on macOS or Linux or the
``dir`` command on Windows to verify that these files have been
created. The three files have been populated with information
from the PyPI metadata and in most cases will not need to be
edited.

These three files are collectively referred to as the "conda
build recipe":

* ``meta.yaml``---Contains all the metadata in the recipe. Only
  the package name and package version sections are
  required---everything else is optional.

* ``bld.bat``---Windows commands to build the package.

* ``build.sh``---macOS and Linux commands to build the package.

Now that you have the conda build recipe ready, you can use conda
build to create the package:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda-build pyinstrument

When conda build is finished, it displays the exact path and
filename of the conda package. See :ref:`troubleshooting` if the
``conda-build`` command fails.

Windows example file path:

.. code-block:: text

    C:\Users\jsmith\Miniconda\conda-bld\win-64\pyinstrument-0.13.1-py27_0.tar.bz2

macOS example file path:

.. code-block:: text

    /Users/jsmith/miniconda/conda-bld/osx-64/pyinstrument-0.13.1-py27_0.tar.bz2


Linux example file path:

.. code-block:: text

    /home/jsmith/miniconda/conda-bld/linux-64/pyinstrument-0.13.1-py27_0.tar.bz2


NOTE: Your path and filename will vary depending on your
installation and operating system. Save the path and filename
information for the next step.

Now you can install your newly-built package in your conda
environment by using the use-local flag:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install --use-local pyinstrument

Now verify that Pyinstrument installed successfully:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda list

At this point you now have a conda package for pyinstrument that
can be installed in any conda environment of the same Python
version as your root environment. The remaining optional sections
show you how to make packages for other Python versions, other
architectures and how to upload them to your Anaconda.org account.


.. _`python-versions`:

Optional---Building for a different Python version
==================================================
By default, conda build creates packages for the version of
Python installed in the root environment. To build packages for
other versions of Python, you use the ``--python`` flag, followed
by a version. For example, to explicitly build a version of the
Pyinstrument package for Python 3.3, use:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda-build --python 3.3 pyinstrument

Notice that the file printed at the end of the ``conda-build``
output has changed to reflect the requested version of Python.
``conda install`` will look in the package directory for the file
that matches your current Python version.

Windows example file path:

.. code-block:: text

    C:\Users\jsmith\Miniconda\conda-bld\win-64\pyinstrument-0.13.1-py33_0.tar.bz2


macOS example file path:

.. code-block:: text

    /Users/jsmith/miniconda/conda-bld/osx-64/pyinstrument-0.13.1-py33_0.tar.bz2


Linux example file path:

.. code-block:: text

    /home/jsmith/miniconda/conda-bld/linux-64/pyinstrument-0.13.1-py33_0.tar.bz2


NOTE: Your path and filename will vary depending on your
installation and operating system. Save the
path and filename information for the next task.

.. _convert-conda-package:

Optional---Converting conda package for other platforms
========================================================

Now that you have built a package for your current platform with
conda build, you can convert it for use on other platforms with
the ``conda convert`` command and a platform specifier from this
list:

* osx-64.
* linux-32.
* linux-64.
* win-32.
* win-64.
* all.

In the output directory, 1 folder will be created for each of the
1 or more platforms you chose, and each folder will contain a
.tar.bz2 package file for that platform.

Windows:

.. code-block:: text

    conda convert -f --platform all C:\Users\jsmith\Miniconda\conda-bld\win-64\pyinstrument-0.13.1-py27_0.tar.bz2
    -o outputdir\

macOS and Linux:

.. code-block:: text

    conda convert --platform all /home/jsmith/miniconda/conda-bld/linux-64/pyinstrument-0.13.1-py27_0.tar.bz2
    -o outputdir/


NOTE: Change your path and filename to the exact path and
filename you saved in :ref:`python-versions`.

To use these packages, you need to transfer them to other
computers and place them in the correct ``conda-bld/$ARCH``
directory for the platform, where ``$ARCH`` can be ``osx-64``,
``linux-32``, ``linux-64``, ``win-32`` or ``win-64``.

A simpler way is to upload all of the bz2 files to Anaconda.org
as described in the next task.


.. _`upload-to-anaconda-org`:

Optional---Uploading packages to Anaconda.org
==============================================

Anaconda.org, formerly known as binstar.org, is a repository for
public or private packages. Uploading to Anaconda.org allows you
to easily install your package in any environment with just the
conda install command, rather than manually copying or moving the
tarball file from one location to another. You can choose to make
your files public or private. For more information about
Anaconda.org, see the `Anaconda.org documentation
<http://docs.anaconda.org/>`_.

#. Create a free Anaconda.org account and record your new
   Anaconda.org username and password.

#. Run ``conda install anaconda-client`` and enter your
   Anaconda.org username and password.

#. Log into your Anaconda.org account from your Terminal or an Anaconda Prompt with
   the command ``anaconda login``.

Now you can upload the new local packages to Anaconda.org.

Windows:

.. code-block:: text

    anaconda upload C:\Users\jsmith\Miniconda\conda-bld\win-64\pyinstrument-0.13.1-py27_0.tar.bz2


macOS and Linux:

.. code-block:: text

    anaconda upload /home/jsmith/miniconda/conda-bld/linux-64/pyinstrument-0.13.1-py27_0.tar.bz2


NOTE: Change your path and filename to the exact path and
filename you saved in :ref:`python-versions`. Your path and
filename will vary depending on your installation and operating
system.

If you created packages for multiple versions of Python or used
conda convert to make packages for each supported architecture,
you must use the ``anaconda upload`` command to upload each one.
It is considered best practice to create packages for Python
versions 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5 along with all of the architectures.

TIP: If you want to always automatically upload a successful
build to Anaconda.org, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda config --set anaconda_upload yes

You can log out of your Anaconda.org account with the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    anaconda logout


.. _`troubleshooting`:

Troubleshooting a sample issue
===============================

Conda build may produce the error message "Build Package missing."

To explore this error:

#. Create a conda skeleton package for skyfield. The
   ``conda skeleton`` command is:

   .. code-block:: bash

       conda skeleton pypi skyfield

   This command creates the skyfield conda build recipe.

#. Run ``conda-build skyfield`` and observe that it fails with
   the following output:

   .. code-block:: text

       Removing old build environment
       Removing old work directory
       BUILD START: skyfield-0.8-py35_0
       Using Anaconda Cloud api site https://api.anaconda.org
       Fetching package metadata: ......
       Solving package specifications: .
       Error:  Package missing in current osx-64 channels:
         - sgp4 >=1.4

In this example, the conda recipe requires ``sgp4`` for the
skyfield package. The skyfield recipe was created by
``conda skeleton``. This error means that conda could not find
the spg4 package and install it.

Since many PyPI packages depend on other PyPI packages to build
or run, the solution is sometimes as simple as using
``conda skeleton`` to create a conda recipe for the missing
package and then building it:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda skeleton sgp4
    conda build sgp4

You may also try using the ``--recursive`` flag with
``conda skeleton``, but this makes conda recipes for all required
packages, even those that are already available to conda install.


.. _`working_around_proxies`:

Working Around MITM Proxies
===========================

Some corporate environments use proxy services that use Man-In-The-Middle
(MITM) attacks to sniff encrypted traffic. These services can interfere with
SSL connections such as those used by conda and pip to download packages from
repositories such as PyPI.

Whenever possible, you should set up the proxy service's certificates so that
the ``requests`` package used by conda can recognize and use the certificates.

When this is not possible, conda-build versions 3.0.31 and higher have an
option that bypasses SSL certificate verification and allows this traffic to
continue.

``conda skeleton pypi`` can disable SSL verification when pulling packages
from a PyPI server over HTTPS.

WARNING: This option is not recommended. Use this option at your own risk and
only if necessary. This option causes your computer to download and execute
arbitrary code over a connection that it cannot verify as secure.

To disable SSL verification when using ``conda skeleton pypi``, set the
``SSL_NO_VERIFY`` environment variable to either ``1`` or ``True`` (case
insensitive).

On \*nix systems:

.. code-block:: bash

    SSL_NO_VERIFY=1 conda skeleton pypi a_package

And on Windows systems:

.. code-block:: batch

    set SSL_NO_VERIFY=1
    conda skeleton pypi a_package
    set SSL_NO_VERIFY=

We recommend that you unset this environment variable immediately after use.
If it is not unset, some other tools may recognize it and incorrectly use
unverified SSL connections.

Using this option will cause ``requests`` to emit warnings to STDERR about
insecure settings. If you know that what you're doing is safe, or have been
advised by your IT department that what you're doing is safe, you may ignore
these warnings.
