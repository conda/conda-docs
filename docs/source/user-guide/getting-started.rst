Getting started with conda
==========================

.. _navigator-starting:

Conda is a powerful package manager and environment manager that
you use with command line commands at the Anaconda Prompt for Windows,
or in a Terminal window for macOS or Linux.

This 20-minute guide to getting started with conda lets you try out
the major features of conda. You should understand how conda works
when you finish this guide.

SEE ALSO: `Getting started with Anaconda Navigator
<https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/getting-started>`_, a
graphical user interface that lets you use conda in a web-like interface
without having to enter manual commands. Compare the Getting started
guides for each to see which program you prefer.

Before you start
================

You should have already `installed
Anaconda <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/>`_.

.. _starting-conda:

Starting conda
==============

**Windows**

* From the Start menu, search for and open "Anaconda Prompt".

   ..

On Windows, all commands below are typed into the Anaconda Prompt window.

**MacOS**

* Open Launchpad, then click the Terminal icon.

On macOS, all commands below are typed into the Terminal window.

**Linux**

* Open a Terminal window.

On Linux, all commands below are typed into the Terminal window.

.. _managing-conda:

Managing conda
===============

Verify that conda is installed and running on your system by typing:

 .. code::

    conda --version

Conda displays the number of the version that you have installed. You do not
need to navigate to the Anaconda directory.

EXAMPLE: ``conda 4.4.9``

NOTE: If you get an error message, make sure you closed and re-opened the
Terminal window after installing, or do it now. Then verify that you are logged
into the same user account that you used to install Anaconda or Miniconda.

Update conda to the current version. Type the following:

 .. code::

     conda update conda

Conda compares versions and then displays what is available to install.

If a newer version of conda is available, type ``y`` to update:

 .. code::

    Proceed ([y]/n)? y

TIP: We recommend that you always keep conda updated to the latest version.

.. _managing-envs:

Managing Environments
=====================

Conda allows you to to create separate environments containing files, packages
and their dependencies that will not interact with other environments.

When you begin using conda, you already have a default environment named
``base``. You don't want to put programs into your base environment, though.
Create separate environments to keep your programs isolated from each other.

#. Create a new environment and install a package in it.

   We will name the environment ``snowflakes`` and install the package
   BioPython. At the Anaconda Prompt or in your Terminal window, type
   the following:

   .. code::

      conda create --name snowflakes biopython

   Conda checks to see what additional packages ("dependencies")
   Biopython will need, and asks if you want to proceed:

   .. code::

      Proceed ([y]/n)? y

   Type "y" and press Enter to proceed.

#. To use, or "activate" the new environment, type the following:

     * Windows:  ``activate snowflakes``
     * Linux and macOS: ``conda activate snowflakes``

   Now that you are in your ``snowflakes`` environment, any conda
   commands you type will go to that environment until
   you deactivate it.

#. To see a list of all your environments, type:

   .. code::

      conda info --envs

   A list of environments appears, similar to the following:

   .. code::

      conda environments:

          base           /home/username/Anaconda3
          snowflakes   * /home/username/Anaconda3/envs/snowflakes

   TIP: The active environment is the one with an asterisk (*).

#. Change your current environment back to the default (base):

     * Windows:  ``deactivate``
     * Linux, macOS: ``conda deactivate``

   TIP: When the environment is deactivated, its name is no
   longer shown in your prompt, and the asterisk (*) returns to base.
   To verify, you can repeat the  ``conda info --envs`` command.


.. _managing-python:

Managing Python
===============

When you create a new environment, conda installs the same Python version you
used when you downloaded and installed Anaconda. If you want to use a different
version of Python, for example Python 3.5, simply create a new environment and
specify the version of Python that you want.

#. Create a new environment named "snakes" that contains Python 3.5:

   .. code::

      conda create --name snakes python=3.5

   When conda asks if you want to proceed, type "y" and press Enter.

#. Activate the new environment:

     * Windows:  ``activate snakes``
     * Linux, macOS: ``source activate snakes``

#. Verify that the snakes environment has been added and is active:

   .. code::

      conda info --envs

   Conda displays the list of all environments with an asterisk (*)
   after the name of the active environment:

   .. code::

     # conda environments:
     #
     base                     /home/username/anaconda3
     snakes                *  /home/username/anaconda3/envs/snakes
     snowflakes               /home/username/anaconda3/envs/snowflakes

   The active environment is also displayed in front of your prompt in
   (parentheses) or [brackets] like this:

   .. code::

     (snakes) $

#. Verify which version of Python is in your current
   environment:

   .. code::

      python --version

#. Deactivate the snakes environment and return to base environment:

     * Windows: ``deactivate``
     * Linux, macOS: ``source deactivate``


.. _managing-pkgs:

Managing packages
=================

In this section, you check which packages you have installed,
check which are available and look for a specific package and
install it.

#. To find a package you have already installed, first activate the environment
   you want to search. Look above for the commands to
   :ref:`activate your snakes environment <managing-envs>`.

#. Check to see if a package you have not installed named
   "beautifulsoup4" is available from the Anaconda repository
   (must be connected to the Internet):

   .. code::

      conda search beautifulsoup4

   Conda displays a list of all packages with that name on the Anaconda
   repository, so we know it is available.

#. Install this package into the current environment:

   .. code::

      conda install beautifulsoup4

#. Check to see if the newly installed program is in this environment:

   .. code::

      conda list
