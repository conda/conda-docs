Paid support
============

Paid `support <https://anaconda.cloud/support-center>`_,
`courses <https://learning.anaconda.cloud/>`_, and
`consulting <https://www.anaconda.com/professional-services>`_
options are available. Our teaching philosophy is that the best
way to learn is with hands-on experience addressing real-world
problems. Courses are available to individuals online, at
numerous sites, or in-house at your place of business. We also
offer consulting services for the analysis, management and
visualization of scientific and business data or optimizing
your processing workflows on modern hardware and GPUs.

Support is included in purchases of `Anaconda's Enterprise tier <https://www.anaconda.com/enterprise/>`_.

Contribute recipes to GitHub
============================

The conda community has transitioned into using feedstocks, which
are repositories that contain package recipes and all of the necessary
configurations for building those recipes. This enables these packages
to be automatically built using continuous integration (CI) services.

You can clone or fork many package feedstocks from `Anaconda Recipes
<https://github.com/AnacondaRecipes>`_, though you can't submit new
feedstocks to that GitHub organization. To contribute new conda package
feedstocks, submit them to `conda-forge
<https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes>`_ or `bioconda
<https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes>`_ with a pull request.

Feedstocks are welcome for programs that use any license, such as GPL,
BSD, MIT or Apache, and all of the recipes the conda-forge and
bioconda repositories are released into the public domain.

Report bugs
===========

If you find a bug, search to see if it has already been reported,
and then report it if no one else has.

Issues with the conda documentation are tracked on GitHub at
https://github.com/conda/conda-docs/issues.

For issues with conda, conda-build, repo.anaconda.com, anaconda.org,
and specific conda packages, please see :ref:`new-issues`.
