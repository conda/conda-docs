Contribute recipes to GitHub
===============================

Submit new recipes to the GitHub repository at
https://github.com/conda/conda-recipes. When you build a new conda
recipe for a program not yet listed in the repository, use a GitHub
pull request to submit it to the repository, so that others using
that program in the future can reuse it. Recipes are welcome for
programs that use any license, such as GPL, BSD, MIT or Apache, and
all of the recipes in thisrepository are released into the public
domain.


Report bugs
==============

If you find a bug, search to see if it has already been reported,
and then report it if no one else has.

Issues with the conda documentation are tracked on GitHub at
https://github.com/conda/conda-docs/issues.

For issues with conda, conda-build, repo.anaconda.com, anaconda.org,
and specific conda packages, please see :ref:`new-issues`.
