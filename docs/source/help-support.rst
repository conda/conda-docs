Paid support
============

The conda organization does not directly offer paid support, training, or 
consultation on conda package management or creation. However, this section 
lists organizations that do provide such services. If your organization would 
like to be added to this list, please open a pull request against the conda-docs repository.

Anaconda
--------

See Anaconda's `Help and Support page <https://docs.anaconda.com/reference/help-support/>`_ 
for information on its paid support and consultation programs.

Contribute recipes to GitHub
============================

The conda community has transitioned into using feedstocks, which
are repositories that contain package recipes and all of the necessary
configurations for building those recipes. This enables these packages
to be automatically built using continuous integration (CI) services.

You can clone or fork many package feedstocks from `Anaconda Recipes
<https://github.com/AnacondaRecipes>`_, though you can't submit new
feedstocks to that GitHub organization. To contribute new conda package
feedstocks, submit them to `conda-forge
<https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes>`_ or `bioconda
<https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes>`_ with a pull request.

Feedstocks are welcome for programs that use any license, such as GPL,
BSD, MIT or Apache, and all of the rt has already been reported,
and then report it if no one else has.

Issues with the conda documentation are tracked on GitHub at
https://github.com/conda/conda-docs/issues.

.. note:: 
  
   The conda-docs repository includes documentation that is common for conda
   and conda-build, as well as landing pages for those projects.

   The documentation for conda, conda-build, and other conda-related
   projects can be found in their respective repositories.

   To create issues for conda, conda-build, repo.anaconda.com, anaconda.org,
   and specific conda packages, please see the individual repo 
   links in the :ref:`New issues <new-issues>` section of the Contributing guide.

Conda Announce mailing list
===========================

Conda Announce (`announce@lists.conda.org <https://lists.conda.org/wws/info/announce>`_)

* Project announcements relevant to all conda users.
* No corporate marketing hype.
* No spam.
