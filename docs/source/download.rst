Download conda
==============

Conda can be downloaded with an array of options. This page is to help you decide among the various options.  
To download conda, you will download Anaconda or Miniconda (both are free), or purchase Anaconda Server. All 
can be downloaded with Python 2.7 (most popular and stable), or Python 3.4 (most recent stable version). You 
can choose a version with a GUI or a command line installer. 

TIP: If you are unsure, we recommend the most recent version of Anaconda - that automatically includes 
Python 2.7, the most popular version of Python. If you are on Windows or OS X, we recommend you also choose 
the version with GUI installer. 

Should I download Anaconda or Miniconda? 
----------------------------------------

**Choose Anaconda if you:** 

* Are new to conda or Python
* Like the convenience of having Python and about a hundred scientific packages automatically installed at once
* Have the time and disk space (about 100 GB, 20 minutes to an hour to install), and/or
* Don’t want to install each of the hundred packages individually.

**Choose Miniconda if you:**

* Do not mind installing about 100 programs each individually
* Do not have time or disk space to install 100 programs at once, and/or
* Just want fast access to Python and the conda commands, and wish to sort out the other programs later. 

Miniconda download: http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html

Which version of Anaconda or Miniconda should I choose?
-------------------------------------------------------

* Whether you use Anaconda or Miniconda, select the most recent version. 
* Only if you are testing or need an older version for a specific purpose should you select an older version from the `archive <https://repo.continuum.io/archive/>`_. 

Should I choose GUI installer or command line installer?
--------------------------------------------------------

Whether you are on Mac, Windows or Linux, there is an installer to make it easy for you. 

* If you do not wish to enter commands in a terminal window, choose the GUI installer. 
* If GUIs slow you down, choose the command line version. 

What version of Python should I choose?
---------------------------------------

* The most popular version of Python is 2.7, and that is included with Anaconda and Miniconda. 
* The newest stable version of Python is 3.4, and that is included with Anaconda3 and Miniconda3. 
* You can easily set up additional versions of Python such as 2.6 or 3.3 by downloading any version and creating a new environment with just a few clicks. (See our Test Drive page.)

What about MD5 or SHA verification?
-----------------------------------

If you download Anaconda, you can use MD5 or SHA to verify your download. 

Note: MD5 or SHA verification is not available for Miniconda.

Get the actual MD5 or SHA1 sum for your Anaconda package here: http://continuum.io/md5

You will use this actual sum in the next step. 

Download the package, then before installing, do the following to verify the package: 

**Linux users:**

* MD5:  ``md5sum path/to/filename.ext``
* SHA1: ``sha1sum path/to/filename.ext``

Note: replace md5sum or sha1sum with the actual sum. 

Note: replace the path/to/filename.ext with the actual path, filename and extension. 

**Mac users:**

* MD5: ``md5 path/to/filename.ext``
* SHA1: ``sha1 path/to/filename.ext``

Note: replace md5sum or sha1sum with the actual sum. 

Note: replace the path/to/filename.ext with the actual path, filename and extension. 

**Windows users:**

Use the free online verifier tool on the Microsoft website: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/841290 

Download and extract the file, then open a Command Prompt window. 

Navigate to the file, then enter the following command: 

* MD5:  fciv.exe C:\path\to\file.ext
* SHA1: fciv.exe –sha1 C:\path\to\file.ext

Note: replace md5sum or sha1sum with the actual sum. 

Note: replace the C:\path\to\file.ext with the actual path, filename and extension.
