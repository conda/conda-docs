Quick Install
=============

Conda is a cross-platform package manager and environment manager program that installs, runs, and updates packages and their dependencies, so you can easily set up and switch between environments on your local computer.  Conda is included in all versions of **Anaconda**, **Anaconda Server**, and **Miniconda**.

The fastest way to get and install conda is to download Miniconda, a bootstrap version of Anaconda that includes just conda, its dependencies, and Python. Anaconda has all that plus 150+ open source packages that install at the same time, and 250 packages that can be installed with the simple ``conda install`` command. 

You can be using Python in two minutes or less with this quick install guide - including install, update and uninstall. If you have any problems, please see the full installation instructions.

QUICK TIP: If you prefer to have the 150+ open source packages included with Anaconda, and have ten minutes for them to install, you can download Anaconda simply by replacing the below word  “Miniconda” with “Anaconda.” 


Miniconda quick install requirements
------------------------------------

32 or 64 bit computer, 32MB available, Linux, Macintosh or Windows.

Note: If you choose to install the full Anaconda package, it requires 300+ MB for the download plus another 300+ to install it.
