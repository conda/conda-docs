Conda
=====


Conda is a cross-platform, Python-agnostic binary package manager. It is the package manager used by Anaconda
installations, but it may be used for other systems as well. Conda makes environments first-class citizens, making it
easy to create independent environments even for C libraries. Conda is written entirely in Python, and is BSD licensed
open source.
