Conda
=====


Conda is a cross-platform, Python-agnostic binary package manager. It is the package manager used by `Anaconda
<https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_ installations, but it may be used for other systems as well. Conda makes
environments first-class citizens, making it easy to create independent environments even for C libraries. Conda is
written entirely in Python, and is `BSD licensed open source <http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php>`_.
