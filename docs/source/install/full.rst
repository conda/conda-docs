Full installation
=================

.. contents::

Conda is a cross-platform package manager and environment manager program that installs, runs, and updates 
packages and their dependencies, so you can easily set up and switch between environments on your local 
computer.  Conda is included in all versions of **Anaconda, Anaconda Server**, and **Miniconda**.

If you are in a hurry, try our two-minute :doc:`Miniconda quick install <quick>`. 
Miniconda includes only conda, conda-build, and their dependencies so you can install cleanly and quickly.

These instructions are for a full install of Anaconda, which includes conda, conda-build, and 150+ 
open source packages. 

On Windows, OS X, and Linux, it is best to install Anaconda for the local user, 
which does not require administrator permissions and is the most robust type of 
installation. For users on any of the three platforms who need to do so, 
Anaconda can also be installed system wide, which does require administrator 
permissions.

TIP: For installation instructions using our graphical installers for OS X or Windows, please see 
the `Anaconda Install <http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html>`_ page.
