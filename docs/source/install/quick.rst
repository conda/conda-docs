Quick install
=============

.. contents::

Conda is a cross-platform package and environment manager that installs, 
runs, and updates packages and their dependencies. It allows you to easily set up and switch 
between environments on your local computer.  Conda is included in all versions 
of **Anaconda** and **Miniconda**.

The fastest way to get and install conda is to `download Miniconda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_,
a mini version of Anaconda that includes just conda and its dependencies. 
Anaconda has all that plus over 720 open source packages that install with Anaconda or 
can be installed with the simple ``conda install`` command. 

In its default configuration conda uses the hundreds of packages at
repo.continuum.io that are built, reviewed, and maintained by Continuum Analytics.

TIP: If you prefer to have the over 720 open source packages included with Anaconda, 
and have a few minutes and the disk space required, you can download Anaconda simply by 
replacing the word “Miniconda” with “Anaconda” in the examples below.

Miniconda quick install requirements
