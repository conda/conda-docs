Tutorial: Basic tutorial for building a Conda package
=====================================================

Continuum's Conda toolset provides cross-platform binary package management.
Originally built to furnish Python distributions, the tools are in active
development and being applied in many use cases. This tutorial explores what
goes into building conda packages, particularly for a typical Python package
built with

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py install

Conda packaging can be as simple as issuing a one-line command. Linked
libraries are located relative to the binary (rather than referenced with
absolute paths) and the software is bundled and ready to ship.

Other package builds are not trivial, especially if complex dependencies are
involved or the package was built in an ad-hoc way that does not conform to
the usual placement of files relative to one another. This tutorial will move
through the gradations of difficulty to illustrate both the potential and
challenges of using conda to package and distribute your software.

Install conda and conda-build
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Conda is installed as part of `Continuum's Anaconda
<https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_ distribution. A lightweight
standalone distribution called `Miniconda
<http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_ is also available, which is what
this tutorial will assume. Upon downloading the installer script, make sure
that this installer has appropriate permissions:

On Linux and Mac OS X, run ``bash`` on the Miniconda installer, like

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bash Miniconda-3.5.2-Linux-x86_64.sh

(you may need to replace the filename with the correct filename for the
installer you downloaded)

On Windows, open and run the .exe installer.

You will not need administrative access to run Conda or manage Conda
environments.

Provide the script with your choices about where to install conda and whether
or not the path will be added to your environment. This tutorial will assume
it is added to the path; otherwise you will have to know the explicit path to
your conda executable.

Once Conda is installed, relaunch a terminal window and confirm that:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda info

finds the executable where you have just installed it. If you did not add Anaconda
or Miniconda to your PATH (the default option) you will have to supply its
path explicitly.

It's a useful habit to do:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda update conda

with a fresh install. You can run the ``update`` command for any installed
package, including conda itself. This intrinsic bootstrapping capacity makes
conda very powerful. In fact, if you started with the Miniconda installation,
you can expand it to the full `Anaconda
distribution <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_ with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda install anaconda

but that's not the focus here.

What you do need to install is ``conda-build``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda install conda-build

On Linux, you may also need to install ``patchelf``.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda install patchelf

Clone conda-recipes from GitHub
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `conda recipes <https://github.com/conda/conda-recipes>`_ repo on GitHub
has many example conda recipes. This is not a necessary step to build your own
packages, but it's a very useful resource to investigate existing recipes for
similar packages to the one you are trying to build. In many cases, a recipe
for the package you are trying to build may already exist there. If you do not
have git installed you will need to install it first.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/conda/conda-recipes

After getting familiar with full process of package building, feel free to add
your own new recipes to this repository by making a pull request.

Elementary Conda Package Building
=================================

Using conda skeleton to build from a PyPI package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is easy to build a skeleton recipe for any Python package that is hosted on
`PyPI
<https://pypi.python.org/>`_.


Let's generate a new conda recipe for `pyinstrument <https://github.com/joerick/pyinstrument>`_, by using
`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/>`_ metadata:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd ~/
    $ conda skeleton pypi pyinstrument

You should verify the
existence of the ``meta.yaml``, ``build.sh``, and ``bld.bat`` files in a newly created
directory called ``pyinstrument``.

You should always check the ``meta.yaml`` file output from the ``skeleton``
subcommand invocation, as it is not perfect, and it often requires some things
to be filled in manually. For instance, some packages do not specify
dependencies properly in their setup.py, so they will need to be added
manually. Some hints for Python package dependencies:

* If you get an error saying that setuptools downloading is disabled during
  conda build, this means that setuptools is trying to download and install a
  dependency of the package. Dependencies should be split out into separate
  packages, so this is disallowed, as it would create a single package with
  all the dependencies. The fix is to add this package as both a run and build
  time dependency in the ``requirements`` section of the meta.yaml.

* If the build or test fails with an ImportError for an external library, it
  means it needs to depend on it.

* If a build fails with an ImportError for pkg_resources, it means it needs to
  depend on setuptools (or alternately, you can write a patch for the package
  that removes the runtime dependence on pkg_resources).

Now, it should be straightforward to use the ``conda build`` tool. Let's try it:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda build pyinstrument

Now everything works great and the package was saved to
~/miniconda/conda-bld/linux-64/pyinstrument-0.12_py270.tar.bz2 file. The exact
location of the file may be a little different for you, depending on where you
have conda installed and what operating system you are using. conda build will
tell you where the file is located at the end of the build.

Later you will upload this package to Binstar, but for now, you can install it
with the ``--use-local`` flag.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conda install --use-local pyinstrument

Building packages for other platforms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Once a package is built for the current platform with ``conda build``,
you can convert it for use on other platforms with the ``conda convert`` command
and a ``-p`` platform specifier from ``{osx-64,linux-32,linux-64,win-32,win-64,all}``.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conda convert -p all ~/miniconda/conda-bld/linux-64/pyinstrument-0.12_py270.tar.bz2 -o outputdir/

These converted packages can then also be individually uploaded to Binstar.


Writing the meta.yaml by hand
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Suppose you stick with the same package, ``pyinstrument``, but don't start
from conda skeleton pypi. You can fill in the values in ``meta.yaml``
manually, based on other conda recipes and information about where to download
the tarball.

The easiest way to do this is to start from an existing example from the
`conda-recipes <https://github.com/conda/conda-recipes>`_ repo.  Take the
``meta.yaml`` file from the ``pyfaker`` package:

.. code-block:: yaml

    package:
      name: pyfaker

    source:
      git_tag: 0.3.2
      git_url: https://github.com/tpn/faker.git

    requirements:
      build:
        - python
        - setuptools

      run:
        - python

    test:
      imports:
        - faker

    about:
      home: http://www.joke2k.net/faker
      license: MIT

With a search on the `GitHub site of
pyinstrument <https://github.com/joerick/pyinstrument>`_ and some sensible
choices for substitutions, you get a makeshift .yaml for ``pyinstrument``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    package:
      name: pyinstrument

    source:
      git_tag: 0.12
      git_url: https://github.com/joerick/pyinstrument.git

    requirements:
      build:
        - python
        - setuptools

      run:
        - python

    test:
      imports:
        - pyinstrument

    about:
      home: https://github.com/joerick/pyinstrument
      license: BSD
      summary: "Call stack profiler for Python. Inspired by Apple's Instruments.app"

This seems reasonable. Being sure to supply ``build.sh`` and ``bld.bat`` files in the
same directory. For Python packages, these can just be ``python setup.py
install`` for both.

Note that the original recipe was built using a tarball from PyPI:

.. code-block:: yaml

    fn: pyinstrument-0.12.tar.gz
    url: https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pyinstrument/pyinstrument-0.12.tar.gz

whereas this one was built using a git url and a git tag:

.. code-block:: yaml

      git_tag: 0.12
      git_url: https://github.com/joerick/pyinstrument.git

Both ways should work just fine. As the source should be identical. For some C
packages, building from a tarball may be preferable to building from git, as
building from git requires more build tools, such as autoconf. For pure Python
packages such as pyinstrument, there is generally no difference.

There is more information about all the values that can go in the
``meta.yaml`` file on the :ref:`build` page.

Uploading packages to `binstar.org <https://binstar.org>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All of above steps produce one object - the package (a tar.bz2
archive). During package building process you were asked if the package should
be uploaded to `binstar.org <https://binstar.org>`__. To get more info about
`binstar.org <https://binstar.org>`__ visit `the Binstar documentation page
<http://docs.binstar.org/>`_.

Here is a minimal summary. First, you need the ``binstar`` command line
client. Install this tool by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conda install binstar

Now you should `register an account on binstar.org
<https://binstar.org/account/register>`_.  Then login with the ``binstar``
command

.. code-block:: bash

   $ binstar login

One this is done, you are ready to upload your package.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ binstar upload ~/miniconda/conda-bld/linux-64/pyinstrument-0.12-py27_0.tar.bz

Replace this path with the path to the package printed at the end of conda
build.

If you always want conda build to upload to Binstar after a successful build,
you can run

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conda config --set binstar_upload yes

If you then want to install these packages, it is recommended to add your
Binstar channel to the conda configuration, so that conda will always search
your channel in addition to the default Continuum ones.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conda config --add channels your_username

(replace ``your_username`` with your Binstar username).

Searching for already existing packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You have two methods to accomplish this task. First option is to use ``conda
search``. ``conda`` searches all the channels configured from the ``.condarc``
file for the given string. You can see what channels are searched by running

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conda info

If there is no ``.condarc`` file, conda only searches the default Continuum
channels, which are officially maintained by `Continuum Analytics
<http://continuum.io/>`_. This includes all the packages from the Anaconda
distribution.

For example, to search for the ``sympy`` package, type

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda search sympy

Sometimes you may want to follow a person who is constantly building new
packages and publishing them on `binstar.org <https://binstar.org>`__. To be
able to use those packages you have to add appropriate channel of that person
to your ``~/.condarc`` file, just like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    channels:
        - defaults
        - asmeurer
        - mutirri

In this example you have added two new channels (of ``asmeurer`` and
``mutirri``).  Note that for Binstar channels, it is only necessary to enter
the username of the person. You can also add the full channel url, like
``https://conda.binstar.org/asmeurer``.

From now on you will be able to search for any package in these users' package
lists, and install them too.

Another way to do this is through the command line using the ``conda config``
option.

.. code-block:: yaml

   $ conda config --add channels asmeurer
   $ conda config --add channels mutirri

The order of the channels matters. If two channels have the same version of
the same package, the one from higher in the list will be chosen.  The ``conda
config`` command will always prepend the channel (add it to the top of the
list).

You can also search all of Binstar, without adding channels to the
``.condarc`` file using the ``binstar`` command.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ binstar search sympy

This command will search through all users' packages on `binstar.org
<http://binstar.org>`__.  **But remember**, to be able to install a package
which was found in this way, you still have to add the appropriate user's channel
to your ``.condarc`` file.

Another way to do this is to run the conda tool with the ``-c`` flag, which
adds the channel just for that one command. For example, to install the
``pyinstrument`` package from ``asmeurer``'s Binstar channel, run

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda install -c asmeurer pyinstrument
