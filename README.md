+# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
+# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
+# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
+# documentation.
+
+# üíÅ The OpenShift Starter workflow will:
+# - Checkout your repository
+# - Perform a container image build
+# - Push the built image to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
+# - Log in to your OpenShift cluster
+# - Create an OpenShift app from the image and expose it to the internet
+
+# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Configure your repository and the workflow with the following steps:
+# 1. Have access to an OpenShift cluster. Refer to https://www.openshift.com/try
+# 2. Create the OPENSHIFT_SERVER and OPENSHIFT_TOKEN repository secrets. Refer to:
+#   - https://github.com/redhat-actions/oc-login#readme
+#   - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets
+#   - https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_secret_set
+# 3. (Optional) Edit the top-level 'env' section as marked with 'üñäÔ∏è' if the defaults are not suitable for your project.
+# 4. (Optional) Edit the build-image step to build your project.
+#    The default build type is by using a Dockerfile at the root of the repository,
+#    but can be replaced with a different file, a source-to-image build, or a step-by-step buildah build.
+# 5. Commit and push the workflow file to your default branch to trigger a workflow run.

+# This workflow will build and push a new container image to Amazon ECR,
+# and then will deploy a new task definition to Amazon ECS, when there is a push to the "paradice" branch.
+#
+# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following set-up steps:
+#
+# 1. Create an ECR repository to store your images.
+#    For example: `aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-ecr-repo --region us-east-2`.
+#    Replace the value of the `ECR_REPOSITORY` environment variable in the workflow below with your repository's name.
+#    Replace the value of the `AWS_REGION` environment variable in the workflow below with your repository's region.
+#
+# 2. Create an ECS task definition, an ECS cluster, and an ECS service.
+#    For example, follow the Getting Started guide on the ECS console:
+#      https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-east-2#/firstRun
+#    Replace the value of the `ECS_SERVICE` environment variable in the workflow below with the name you set for the Amazon ECS service.
+#    Replace the value of the `ECS_CLUSTER` environment variable in the workflow below with the name you set for the cluster.
+#
+# 3. Store your ECS task definition as a JSON file in your repository.
+#    The format should follow the output of `aws ecs register-task-definition --generate-cli-skeleton`.
+#    Replace the value of the `ECS_TASK_DEFINITION` environment variable in the workflow below with the path to the JSON file.
+#    Replace the value of the `CONTAINER_NAME` environment variable in the workflow below with the name of the container
+#    in the `containerDefinitions` section of the task definition.
+#
+# 4. Store an IAM user access key in GitHub Actions secrets named `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
+#    See the documentation for each action used below for the recommended IAM policies for this IAM user,
+#    and best practices on handling the access key credentials.

+
+# üíÅ The OpenShift Starter workflow will:
+# - Checkout your repository
+# - Perform a container image build
+# - Push the built image to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
+# - Log in to your OpenShift cluster
+# - Create an OpenShift app from the image and expose it to the internet
+
+# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Configure your repository and the workflow with the following steps:
+# 1. Have access to an OpenShift cluster. Refer to https://www.openshift.com/try
+# 2. Create the OPENSHIFT_SERVER and OPENSHIFT_TOKEN repository secrets. Refer to:
+#   - https://github.com/redhat-actions/oc-login#readme
+#   - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets
+#   - https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_secret_set
+# 3. (Optional) Edit the top-level 'env' section as marked with 'üñäÔ∏è' if the defaults are not suitable for your project.
+# 4. (Optional) Edit the build-image step to build your project.
+#    The default build type is by using a Dockerfile at the root of the repository,
+#    but can be replaced with a different file, a source-to-image build, or a step-by-step buildah build.
+# 5. Commit and push the workflow file to your default branch to trigger a workflow run.

+
+[![Publish](https://github.com/npm/documentation/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/npm/documentation/actions/workflows/publish.yml)
+
+This is the documentation for
+[https://docs.npmjs.com/](https://docs.npmjs.com/).
+
+[This repository](https://github.com/npm/documentation) contains the
+content for our documentation site, and the GitHub Actions workflows
+that generate the site itself.
+
+## Quick start
+
+1. `npm install` to download gatsby, our theme, and the dependencies
+2. `npm run develop`: starts the test server at `http://localhost:8000`.
+3. Update the content - it's Mdx, which is like markdown - in the `content`
+   directory.
+4. Review your content at `http://localhost:8000`.  (Gatsby watches the
+   filesystem and will reload your content changes immediately.)
+5. Once you're happy, commit it and open a pull request at
+   https://github.com/npm/documentation.
+6. A CI workflow run will publish your PR to a GitHub Preview Page.
+7. Once the content is reviewed, merge the pull request.  That will
+   [deploy the site](https://github.com/npm/documentation/actions/workflows/publish.yml).
+
+Do you want to know more? Check out our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
+
+## Theme
+
+The gatsby theme used here is "[doctornpm](https://github.com/npm/doctornpm)" - a variation of
+[doctocat](https://github.com/primer/doctocat) with some theme changes
+for npm's design language and additional components to support multiple
+versions of the CLI documentation.

+
+If you want to create a new branch for your pull request and do not have write permissions to the repository, you can fork the repository first. For more information, see "[Creating a pull request from a fork](/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)" and "[About forks](/articles/about-forks)."
+
+You can specify which branch you'd like to merge your changes into when you create your pull request. Pull requests can only be opened between two branches that are different.
+
+{% data reusables.pull_requests.perms-to-open-pull-request %}
+
+{% data reusables.pull_requests.close-issues-using-keywords %}
+
+## Changing the branch range and destination repository
+
+By default, pull requests are based on the parent repository's default branch. For more information, see "[About branches](/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-branches#about-the-default-branch)."
+
+If the default parent repository isn't correct, you can change both the parent repository and the branch with the drop-down lists. You can also swap your head and base branches with the drop-down lists to establish diffs between reference points. References here must be branch names in your GitHub repository.
+
+![Pull Request editing branches](/assets/images/help/pull_requests/pull-request-review-edit-branch.png)
+
+When thinking about branches, remember that the *base branch* is **where** changes should be applied, the *head branch* contains **what** you would like to be applied.
+
+When you change the base repository, you also change notifications for the pull request. Everyone that can push to the base repository will receive an email notification and see the new pull request in their dashboard the next time they sign in.
+
+When you change any of the information in the branch range, the Commit and Files changed preview areas will update to show your new range.
+
+{% tip %}
+
+**Tips**:
+
+- Using the compare view, you can set up comparisons across any timeframe. For more information, see "[Comparing commits](/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/viewing-and-comparing-commits/comparing-commits)."
+
+- Project maintainers can add a pull request template for a repository. Templates include prompts for information in the body of a pull request. For more information, see "[About issue and pull request templates](/articles/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates)."

+To assign a pull request to an individual, use the `--assignee` or `-a` flags. You can use `@me` to self-assign the pull request.
+
+```shell
+
+gh pr create --assignee "@octocat"
+
+```
+
+To specify the branch into which you want the pull request merged, use the `--base` or `-B` flags. To specify the branch that contains commits for your pull request, use the `--head` or `-H` flags.
+
+```shell
+
+gh pr create --base my-base-branch --head my-changed-branch
+
+```
+
+To include a title and body for the new pull request, use the `--title` and `--body` flags.
+
+```shell
+
+gh pr create --title "The bug is fixed" --body "Everything works again"
+
+```
+
+To mark a pull request as a draft, use the `--draft` flag.
+
+```shell
+
+gh pr create --draft
+
+```
+
+To add a labels or milestones to the new pull request, use the `--label` and `--milestone`  flags.
+
+```shell
+
+gh pr create --label "bug,help wanted" --milestone octocat-milestone
+
+```
+
+To add the new pull request to a specific project, use the `--project` flag.
+
+```shell
+
+gh pr create --project octocat-project
+
+```
+
+To assign an individual or team as reviewers, use the `--reviewer` flag.
+
+```shell
+
+gh pr create --reviewer monalisa,hubot  --reviewer myorg/team-name
+
+```

+# and then will deploy it to Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK), when there is a push to the "paradice" branch.
+#
+# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following set-up steps:
+#
+# 1. Create an ACR repository to store your container images. 
+#    You can use ACR EE instance for more security and better performance.
+#    For instructions see https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/142168.htm
+#
+# 2. Create an ACK cluster to run your containerized application.
+#    You can use ACK Pro cluster for more security and better performance.
+#    For instructions see https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/95108.htm
+#
+# 3. Store your AccessKey pair in GitHub Actions secrets named `ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `ACCESS_KEY_SECRET`.
+#    For instructions on setting up secrets see: https://developer.github.com/actions/managing-workflows/storing-secrets/
+#
+# 4. Change the values for the REGION_ID, REGISTRY, NAMESPACE, IMAGE, ACK_CLUSTER_ID, and ACK_DEPLOYMENT_NAME.

+# This workflow will build and push a new container image to Alibaba Cloud Container Registry (ACR),
+# and then will deploy it to Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK), when there is a push to the "paradice" branch.
+#
+# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following set-up steps:
+#
+# 1. Create an ACR repository to store your container images. 
+#    You can use ACR EE instance for more security and better performance.
+#    For instructions see https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/142168.htm
+#
+# 2. Create an ACK cluster to run your containerized application.
+#    You can use ACK Pro cluster for more security and better performance.
+#    For instructions see https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/95108.htm
+#
+# 3. Store your AccessKey pair in GitHub Actions secrets named `ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `ACCESS_KEY_SECRET`.
+#    For instructions on setting up secrets see: https://developer.github.com/actions/managing-workflows/storing-secrets/
+#
+# 4. Change the values for the REGION_ID, REGISTRY, NAMESPACE, IMAGE, ACK_CLUSTER_ID, and ACK_DEPLOYMENT_NAME.

Morningstar‚Äôs Behavioral Insights Team researches savings and investing behavior to help individual investors and their ecosystem avoid common behavioral biases, and has published books and articles on the topic of applying behavioral science to digital platforms. Because we offer an extensive line of products for individual investors, professional financial advisors, and institutional clients, we have a broad view on the RFI and the assessment of market practices associated with the use of digital engagement practices (DEPs). This letter contains: 1) a summary of our views; 2) a description of a Morningstar survey on a nationally representative sample of Americans about their use of trading apps and exposure to DEPs; and 3) detailed answers to selected questions posed in the RFI. We utilize our survey responses to address some of these questions and present specific findings in our answers. The survey consists of two parts: a screener for demographic information, attached as Appendix B, and the complete set of questions about individual experiences and views of DEPs, attached as Appendix C. 1 SEC. 2021.

# This workflow will build and push a new container image to Alibaba Cloud Container Registry (ACR),
# and then will deploy it to Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK), when there is a push to the "paradice" branch.
#
# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following set-up steps:
#
# 1. Create an ACR repository to store your container images.
#    You can use ACR EE instance for more security and better performance.
#    For instructions see https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/142168.htm
#
# 2. Create an ACK cluster to run your containerized application.
#    You can use ACK Pro cluster for more security and better performance.
#    For instructions see https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/95108.htm
#
# 3. Store your AccessKey pair in GitHub Actions secrets named `ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `ACCESS_KEY_SECRET`.
#    For instructions on setting up secrets see: https://developer.github.com/actions/managing-workflows/storing-secrets/
#
# 4. Change the values for the REGION_ID, REGISTRY, NAMESPACE, IMAGE, ACK_CLUSTER_ID, and ACK_DEPLOYMENT_NAME.
