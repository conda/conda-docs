# channel locations. These override conda defaults, i.e., conda will
# search *only* the channels listed here, in the order given. Use "defaults" to
# automatically include all default channels. Non-url channels will be
# interpreted as binstar usernames (this can be changed by modifying the
# channel_alias key; see below). The default is just 'defaults'.
channels:
  - <binstar_username>
  - http://some.custom/channel

# False.

# Show channel URLs when displaying what is going to be downloaded and
# in 'conda list'. The default is False.
show_channel_urls: True

# Change the command prompt ($PS1) when using activate to include the
# activated environment. The default is True.
changeps1: False

# Use pip when listing packages with 'conda list'. Note that this does not
# affect any conda command or functionality other than the output of the
# command 'conda list'. The default is True.
use_pip: False

# Proxy settings: http://[username]:[password]@[server]:[port]. By default,
# proxy settings are pulled from the HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY environment
# variables. If you do not include the username and passwor, of if
# authentication fails, conda will prompt for a username and password.

# Package specifications to disallow installing. The default is to allow all
# packages.
disallow:
  - anaconda

# When the channel alias is binstar.org or an Anaconda Server GUI, this will
# use the binstar command line client (which can be installed with 'conda
# install binstar') to automatically add the token to the channel urls, so
# that you can see private packages. The default is True, but it is only
# enabled if the binstar command line client is installed and you are logged
# in ('binstar login').

# Directories in which environments are located. If this key is set, the root
# prefix envs dir is not used unless explicitly included. This key also
# determines where the package caches will be located. For each envs here,
# envs/.pkgs will be used as the pkgs cache, except for standard the envs
# directory in the root directory, for which the normal root_dir/pkgs is used.
# The CONDA_ENVS_PATH environment variable, which is a colon separated list,
# allows overwriting this setting here.

# Disallow soft-linking. When this is True, conda uses hard-links when
# possible, and soft-links (i.e., symlinks) when hard-links are not possible
# (e.g., when installing on another filesystem).  When this is False, conda
# still uses hard-links when possible, but when they are not possible, it
# copies files. Note that individual packages may specify that specific files
# should never be soft-linked, independent of this option (see the no_link
# option in the build recipe documentation). The default is True.
allow_softlinks: False

# When creating new environments add these packages by default. You can
# override this option with the --no-default-packages flag. The default is not
# to include any packages.
create_default_packages:
  - python

# Enable certain features to be tracked by default. The default is to not
